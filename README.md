About
=====

For python files, the default ``gf`` command is not really helpful. This plugin
replaces the ``gf`` (goto file) command for Python files.


Usage
=====

Get https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/ and install pythonGotoFile:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    ~/.vim/bundle$ git clone https://github.com/tehmaze/vim-pythonGotoFile \
        pythonGotoFile

Enjoy!
